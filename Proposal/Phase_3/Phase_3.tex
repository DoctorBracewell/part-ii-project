\section{Introduction}

Since 2006, improvements made to single-core processor performance have begun to stagnate as we begin to approach theoretical limits in advancements to transistor technology. This has led to an uptake in parallel processing, the act of splitting computations across multiple processors running simultaneously, in order to increase computational throughput by utilising more than one processor at once. However, there have been some limiting factors in the progress of parallel processing - the most prominent of which being the difficulties humans face when attempting to reason about concurrent systems (we assume that concurrency refers specifically to parallelism concurrency in this proposal). Human brains seem to be designed for sequential calculations \cite{Sigman7585} which makes it very hard for us to design and understand systems containing multiple threads of independent, interlocking calculations which are running in parallel. In order to try and aid programmers, modern programming languages often include concurrency primitives to reduce the cognitive load needed to design these sorts of systems, but despite this, many programmers still find concurrency difficult and often opt to avoid it when it is not strictly necessary. This may cause problems in the future as programmers will either have to embrace concurrency, despite its current flaws, or potentially miss out on the yearly performance improvements in computation which have been observed in previous decades.

In this project, I propose a new sequential programming language and a compiler, written in OCaml, which compiles this sequential language to parallelised code at the function level. This means that users can gain the benefits of parallel programming while avoiding many complexities surrounding concurrency. I will design a simple sequential programming language with Go-like syntax, which is provisionally dubbed Kautuka after the woven Indian ``thread''\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kautuka}}. I will compile Kautuka to the Go programming language, automatically parallelising the code during this compilation process using the Go's concurrency primitives: channels and goroutines\footnote{Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime designed to run functions in parallel}.

When compiling from sequential Kautuka to parallel Go code, we expect that the parallel code acts in the same way as the sequential code, regardless of any non-determinism introduced by threads. Hence any instructions which may be affected by running in parallel, namely effects, should be statically analysed before compilation to ensure that effects in different threads do not interfere. And secondly, we expect that the compiler makes an attempt to produce parallel Go code which is computationally faster than the equivalent sequential Go code. Hence we introduce a static analysis: effect tracking and cost analysis into the compiler to ensure these expectations are met. As part of this project, I will implement a novel approach to cost analysis by designing a type system based upon tracking lower and upper bounds of values. My approach to cost analysis and effect tracking is explored in further detail in the next section.

\section{Structure of the Project}

There are five main components to this project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Translation: Building a compiler from Kautuka to sequential Go
  \item Effect tracking: Implementing effect tracking into Kautuka 
  \item Cost analysis: Implementing cost analysis into Kautuka 
  \item Automatic parallelisation: Extending the Translation step to compile Kautuka to parallelised Go based upon the previous two steps
  \item Evaluation: refer to Evaluation section
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Translation}

This involves designing the syntax and semantics of my custom language: Kautuka. Once the syntax and semantics have been formalised, I can use OCaml's lexing and parsing libraries to compile Kautuka to an AST, along with tests to ensure this has been carried out correctly. Finally, I can develop a tool which converts this AST to Go code, and write tests to check that the produced Go code is semantically equivalent to the original Kautuka program. 

\subsection*{Effect tracking}

I will extend the compiler by introducing a basic effect system based upon \cite{Optimising-Compilers-Lecture-13-Effect-Systems}. This will allow me to track the effects which may potentially be introduced by calls to user-defined functions, in order to ensure that parallel threads do not contain conflicting effects. The core project will only focus on the effects of mutating non-local state, but this can be extended to reasoning about console IO and file system effects in my project extensions. However, this project will not focus on pointers and aliases, and so we will assume that pointers of the same type will conflict unless we are explicitly told otherwise by the user.

\subsection*{Cost analysis}

A large part of my project will be implementing an original approach to cost analysis by designing a custom type system which allows us to better estimate the time it takes to run functions. The type system will track the minimum and maximum value of variables\footnote{Value refers to the numerical value for int types and size for string and array types} (henceforth referred to as bounds), and uses inference to update these bounds throughout the program. By measuring the execution time of standard functions for different input size, we can estimate the minimum and maximum execution time of all the standard function calls in a given program. The novelty of this idea is that tracking the lower and upper bounds of variables does not seem to have been used to statically estimate the execution times of functions before. However, tracking the intervals of integer variables seems to be well researched in the field of scientific computing and so I intend to apply some of these ideas to the cost analysis in my project. When determining the runtime of all user-declared functions in the program, I intend to use \cite{10.1145/361002.361016} as a reference for dealing with conditions and loops. Hence, this analysis can be used to estimate how much time would be saved or lost by parallelising sets of functions, taking into consideration any costs incurred by introducing threads. The main tradeoff for my proposed approach is that Kautuka's type system is quite verbose and require a lot of extra type annotations from the user surrounding estimated bounds of variables. In my extensions, we can explore cost analysis in relation to higher-order and first-class functions, also using \cite{10.1145/361002.361016} as a reference, which will add significant complexity to this analysis.

\subsection*{Automatic parallelisation}

Effect tracking allows us to identify combinations of function sets which do not contain any interfering effects. We can then use the cost analysis to determine the best way to schedule functions into separate threads in order to gain the most benefit; this involves determining whether parallelisation will give us any benefit at all compared to compiling functions purely sequentially. If we decide to carry out parallelisation, we will compile the program to Go; making use of goroutines to parallelise functions and channels to pass results out of successfully terminated goroutines (similar to \textit{futures}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises}}).

\section{Evaluation}

\subsection*{Quantitative}
Evaluate the execution time of Kautuka compared to the equivalent sequential Go code. The examples will be handcrafted and well-suited to potential parallelisation optimisation as that is the intended use case of my program.

\subsection*{Qualitative}
Ensure that my compiled language is semantically equivalent to the sequential Go code it is emulating, using the same corpus of examples as above.

\section{Starting Point}

I have limited prior experience in implementing lexers and parsers, and no prior experience in implementing effect systems or cost analysis. However I have studied Semantics of Programming Languages and Compiler Construction which should aid with building the lexer and parser stages of my compiler. Furthermore I have read ahead on the Optimising Compilers course regarding effect systems.

\section{Success Criteria}

For the project to be deemed a success, the following must be successfully completed:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Design the syntax for Kautuka and then develop a compiler from Kautuka to Go. Kautuka should support basic control flow, iterators and (non-first-class and non-higher-order) functions. My compiler will not include type checking, this stage will be carried out when the Go code is compiled further using the standard Go compiler.
  \item Implement effect tracking for Kautuka. In the core project, this is limited to tracking modifications of non-local state. 
  \item Implement cost analysis for Kautuka. This involves creating a type system to track the minimum and maximum values of variables, and then measuring the runtime of standard functions based upon inputs of different sizes. Hence we can calculate the estimated minimum and maximum runtime of functions. 
  \item Parallelise the code during the compilation process based upon this analysis. We want to compile functions into parallel threads if there are no interfering effects and we deem there to be sufficient cost benefit.
  \item Compare the runtime of a Kautuka program compiled to parallelised Go with the equivalent sequential Go code. And also evaluate whether a given Kautuka program is semantically equivalent to the Go code it is compiled to. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Possible Extensions}

Possible extensions include: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add IO support to Kautuka, namely interactions with console IO and the file system.
  \item Add support for first-class functions and higher-order functions to Kautuka.
  \item Add support for data structures, such as structs and enums, to Kautuka.
  \item Seamlessly integrate Kautuka programs with existing Go codebases. This involves developing a tool that allows us to run a project containing both Kautuka and Go files using a combination of both my compiler and the standard Go compiler.
  %\item Give support for different levels of optimisation. For example, higher levels of optimisation can have the potential for a greater improvement in code performance but may be less reliable.
\end{enumerate}
