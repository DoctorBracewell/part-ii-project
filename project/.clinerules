# AI Helper Development Rules for 'continuous pursuit-evasion with aerodynamic constraints'

## Most Important
Do NOT ever run a terminal command after your changes. Inform me when you have finished making changes to the source code and I will review the changes before running the project

## General Guidelines:
- **Command Execution Directory**: Always execute commands from within the `project/` folder. Ensure to `cd project/` before running any commands.
- **Virtual Environment**: Always use the `.venv` virtual environment. Source it before development: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- **Logging**: Utilize `rich` logging for all output to maintain a clean and consistent debug and production experience.
- **Minimal Requests**: When performing tasks, use minimal tool requests. For file changes, consolidate all modifications into a single `replace_in_file` or `write_to_file` call.
- **Code Changes**:
    - Keep code changes as simple and minimal as possible, directly addressing the prompt.
    - Avoid excessive code; respond with the most efficient change. Further elaborations or features will be requested in additional prompts.
    - Focus on minimal line count and simplicity while ensuring readability and maintainability.
    - Create simple abstractions with deep functionality, avoiding excessive features or complexity.

## Project Overview:
This project is a simulation-based Python application designed to run calculations, return data, and generate plots. It supports multiple agents with custom functionality, manages global state and properties, and includes involved plot generation capabilities.
