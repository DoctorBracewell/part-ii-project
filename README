# Part II Dissertation Template

Recommended Setup
- VSCode 
- LaTeX Workshop Plugin (Using TeX Live)

Viewing PDFs is easiest in VSCode, by opening a new VSCode window containing the PDF (which live updates when the LaTeX is changed). 
Alternatively, the Okular PDF viewer has dark-mode settings for late night dissertation writing sessions. 

In the ./Dissertation folder 
- The "prooftree.sty" and "tombstone.sty" files are custom LaTeX packages I used, these can be removed once you remove the LaTeX dependent on them 
- My "preamble.sty" contains lots of extra packages. If you remove the contents of all chapter and appendices files, this file can be replaced with "minimal_preamble.sty"
- To compile, open "./Dissertation/dissertation.tex" and save the file. This should update the PDF file (and spawn many intermediary compilation files, you can ignore these)

Similarly, the proposal files can be compiled by heading to "./Proposal/Phase_2/Phase_2.tex" and "./Proposal/Phase_3/Phase_3.tex" and saving the files.

Feel free to reuse any LaTeX code found in this project, although be warned it is a little hacky at times. 

Enjoy,
Dylan :P
